### Project Description
ChatGPT said:
Blocked & Broken: Call of Regret is a satirical web project that simulates the emotional chaos of calling your ex ‚Äî complete with fake calls, mocking messages, and a downloadable Certificate of Emotional Damage. Built for a ‚ÄúUseless Hackathon,‚Äù it‚Äôs a playful take on heartbreak, regret, and healing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
ChatGPT said:
This project hilariously "solves" the problem of post-breakup impulsiveness ‚Äî that urge to call your ex at 2AM when you really shouldn‚Äôt. It acts as a digital emotional punching bag, letting users spiral safely through rejection without ruining their dignity in real life.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A fake ex-calling simulator that lets you relive the pain, get mocked by sad messages, hear a voicemail of regret, and finally "call yourself" for closure ‚Äî all ending with a downloadable Certificate of Emotional Damage. Because sometimes, healing needs a bit of humor and a lot of nonsense.

### Project Demo

The video showcases the user experience of interacting with the ‚ÄúCall Your Ex‚Äù simulator. It begins with repeated fake call attempts that trigger a variety of humorous and painful rejection messages. After several tries, the call is ‚Äúblocked,‚Äù and a voicemail audio plays ‚Äî a final message of emotional doom.

Following this, the user is prompted to ‚ÄúCall Yourself‚Äù, activating the webcam (video element) to simulate self-reflection. Finally, the system generates and displays a Certificate of Emotional Damage, which the user can download as proof of their poor life decisions. Both ringtone and voicemail audio files enhance the drama and satire throughout the journey.
